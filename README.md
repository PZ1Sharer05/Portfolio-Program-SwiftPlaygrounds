## Portfolio Program by Jeff Lim

I made this portfolio program for a design style thing like the ones you see on Instagram. This program replicates the idea of a profile page on social media sites and designed for using the programmatic UI. This was made in a video by CS Club (me) to learn about Programmatic UI and also learn about some UIKit fundamentals.

### Concept of the Portfolio Program

The concept is simple just try to fill in some of your personal data to make a portfolio. It also contains a scrollable text view where you can add your description and also some personal details.

### Running The Code

To run and see the code that I wrote and also some customizations of your own, run the code of the live preview. If you don't know what is the live preview, go to the top right corner of Xcode and click on the 2 circles next to the 5-lines icon.

# Concept Of Programmatic UI

### What is programmatic UI

Programmatic UI is to make the user interface body of the view, but with swift UIKit auto generated classes. It is much more of a time-wasting experience, but also a very important skill to master. The way to implement one is easy. In the next page, you will see and also try the portfolio program. If you want to learn more about mastering the skills, watch my videos in CS Club. You will learn some basic playground concepts. I teach you from beginner to advanced too.
